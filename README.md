# 🎯 Predictive Modeling for Training Effectiveness

This project provides a complete machine learning pipeline using **synthetic data** to predict how effective a training program will be for individuals based on factors such as trainee experience, engagement, course difficulty, instructor quality, and more.

It includes:
- Regression model to predict training score improvement
- Classification model to label training as "High" or "Low" effectiveness
- Streamlit web app for real-time predictions
- Model saving for deployment

## 🧠 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔢 Regression | Predicts improvement score after training |
| ✅ Classification | Labels training as "High" or "Low" effectiveness |
| 📊 Feature Importance | Visualizes which factors influence training outcomes |
| 💾 Model Deployment | Models saved via `joblib` for reuse |
| 🌐 Streamlit Dashboard | User-friendly web interface to interact with the models |

## 🚀 Streamlit App Preview

Run the web app locally:

```bash
streamlit run app.py

You'll be able to:

    Adjust sliders for training parameters

    Predict effectiveness score

    See if the model flags the training as High/Low effectiveness
